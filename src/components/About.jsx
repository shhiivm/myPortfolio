        Hi, I’m Shivanand Singh – an MCA graduate with a strong foundation in
        Java, JavaScript, and React.js. I enjoy building interactive and
        user-friendly web applications. I have recently completed 10+
        beginner-friendly projects using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript,
        which helped me strengthen my problem-solving and front-end development
        skills. Currently, I am learning the MERN stack (React.js, Node.js,
        Express.js, and MongoDB) to expand my knowledge into full-stack
        development. Alongside my learning, I am also working on hands-on
        projects that involve building real-world applications, integrating
        APIs, and managing databases to gain practical experience in full-stack
        web development. I am passionate about continuous learning, clean code
        practices, and building scalable applications, and I’m excited to grow
        as a developer while contributing to impactful projects.
